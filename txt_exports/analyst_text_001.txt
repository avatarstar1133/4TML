User Stories — Online Bookstore System (TEST FIXTURE) v2.2

(These stories intentionally include a few inconsistencies to help conflict-detection logic.)

AUTHENTICATION & SECURITY
US-AUTH-01
As a visitor, I want to create an account with my email and a password so that I can purchase books.
Acceptance:
- Given I enter a valid email and password, when I submit registration, then my account is created and a verification email is sent.
- Password policy: min length 8, at least 1 digit.

US-AUTH-02
As a new customer, I want to log in right after registration without email verification so that I can explore paid features quickly.
Acceptance:
- Login is allowed immediately after sign-up (email verification can be done later).
(Conflict with SRS FR1.2 which blocks login until verified.)

SESSION
US-SEC-03
As a customer, I want my session to stay alive for at least 15 minutes of inactivity so that I am not logged out too quickly.

(Conflict with SRS FR2.3: 10 minutes.)

PERFORMANCE & OPERATIONS
US-PERF-01

(Conflicts with SRS: Search p95 < 1.5s, Checkout p95 < 2s.)

PRIVACY

INVENTORY
