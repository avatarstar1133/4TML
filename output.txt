# REQUIREMENTS ENGINEERING ANALYSIS REPORT

## Executive Summary
This report analyzes the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) and User Stories for the CampusRide system (v1.2). It identifies critical gaps, high and medium priority issues, and enhancement suggestions. The analysis highlights the need for improved security measures, enhanced functional requirements, and better alignment with user stories to ensure a robust and user-friendly carpool system.

## Critical Issues

*   **Missing Payment Processing:** The SRS lacks any functional requirements for payment processing or fare calculation. This is a critical omission as it directly impacts the viability of the system by failing to address how drivers will be compensated or how fares will be determined.
    *   **Action:** Add the following functional requirements: FR12: 'The system shall support secure payment processing for ride fares.' FR13: 'The system shall provide a mechanism for calculating ride fares based on distance, time, and other relevant factors.' FR14: 'The system shall allow drivers to set their preferred payment methods and receive compensation for completed rides.'
    *   **Impact:** Without payment processing, the system's viability is questionable, as drivers need an incentive to offer rides and passengers need a convenient way to pay.

## High Priority Issues

*   **Enhancement: Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** The SRS does not explicitly require multi-factor authentication.
    *   **Action:** Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for user logins.
    *   **Impact:** Enhances account security by requiring multiple forms of verification, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.
*   **Enhancement: Data Privacy Compliance:** The SRS does not explicitly address compliance with data privacy regulations.
    *   **Action:** Ensure compliance with relevant data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).
    *   **Impact:** Protects user data and avoids legal penalties.

## Medium Priority Issues

*   **Gap: Administrative Review of Trip History:** The SRS lacks a functional requirement detailing how administrators review trip history and user reports, as stated in STORY-006. While SRS-009 mentions recording trip history, it doesn't specify administrative access or reporting capabilities.
    *   **Action:** Add a functional requirement (FR9): 'The system shall provide administrators with the ability to review trip history and generate user reports for monitoring safety and compliance.'
    *   **Impact:** Administrators might not have the necessary tools or access to ensure safety and compliance, hindering their ability to manage the system effectively.
*   **Gap: Security Officer Monitoring of User Registration Logs:** There is no functional requirement to address the security officer's need to monitor user registration logs, as outlined in STORY-007. SRS-003 verifies email addresses but doesn't cover continuous monitoring for suspicious activity.
    *   **Action:** Add a functional requirement (FR10): 'The system shall provide a security officer with the ability to monitor user registration logs for suspicious activities.'
    *   **Impact:** The system's security could be compromised if suspicious registration activities are not actively monitored, potentially leading to unauthorized access or misuse.
*   **Missing NFR: Security Logging and Auditing:** There is no explicit Non-Functional Requirement (NFR) specifying security logging or auditing capabilities to meet the needs of the security officer, as described in STORY-007. While NFR3 mentions data encryption, it does not address logging and monitoring access for security purposes.
    *   **Action:** Add a non-functional requirement (NFR6): 'The system shall maintain a comprehensive audit log of all user registration and access activities, accessible to authorized security personnel for monitoring and analysis.'
    *   **Impact:** Lack of security logging hinders the system's ability to detect and respond to security breaches or unauthorized access attempts, making it difficult to maintain a secure environment.
*   **Enhancement: Regular Security Audits:** The SRS does not explicitly call for regular security audits.
    *   **Action:** Implement regular security audits and penetration testing.
    *   **Impact:** Proactively identifies and addresses security vulnerabilities before they can be exploited.
*   **Enhancement: Scalability:** The SRS does not explicitly address scalability.
    *   **Action:** Design the system to be scalable to accommodate a growing number of users and rides.
    *   **Impact:** Ensures the system can handle increasing demand without performance degradation.
*   **Enhancement: System Monitoring and Alerting:** The SRS does not explicitly address system monitoring and alerting.
    *   **Action:** Implement monitoring and alerting for system performance and errors.
    *   **Impact:** Enables rapid detection and resolution of issues, minimizing downtime and ensuring system stability.
*   **Enhancement: Rating and Review System:** The SRS does not include a system for rating and reviewing users.
    *   **Action:** Implement a system for rating and reviewing drivers and passengers.
    *   **Impact:** Helps to build trust and accountability within the system, improving overall user experience and safety.
*   **Enhancement: Automated Backups and Disaster Recovery:** The SRS does not explicitly address backup and disaster recovery.
    *   **Action:** Implement automated backups and disaster recovery procedures.
    *   **Impact:** Ensures data is protected and the system can be restored quickly in the event of a failure.
*   **Incompleteness: Ride Details:** FR3 only mentions route, time, and number of seats for publishing rides. It does not specify other important information like pickup/drop-off locations, price, or vehicle details.
    *   **Action:** Modify FR3 to read: 'The system shall allow drivers to publish available rides with route, time, number of seats, specific pickup and drop-off locations, price per seat, and vehicle details (e.g., make, model, color).' Also, consider adding a functional requirement to allow drivers to specify ride preferences, such as whether they allow smoking or pets.
    *   **Impact:** Incomplete ride information can lead to confusion and inconvenience for passengers, potentially reducing the usability and adoption of the system.
*   **Gap: User Profile Management:** The system lacks a functional requirement for user profile management. While FR1 and FR2 address registration and verification, there's no mention of users being able to update their profile information, such as contact details or preferences.
    *   **Action:** Add a functional requirement (FR11): 'The system shall allow users to manage their profile information, including contact details (phone number, alternate email), profile picture and ride preferences (e.g., preferred communication method, notification preferences).'
    *   **Impact:** The absence of user profile management hinders the ability to maintain accurate user information and customize the user experience, potentially leading to dissatisfaction.
*   **Missing NFR: Security Measures:** There is no specific NFR related to security aspects beyond data encryption. Aspects like authorization, authentication strength (e.g., multi-factor authentication), and protection against common web vulnerabilities (e.g., OWASP Top 10) are not addressed.
    *   **Action:** Add a non-functional requirement (NFR7): 'The system shall implement robust security measures, including strong authentication (e.g., multi-factor authentication), authorization controls, and protection against common web vulnerabilities as defined by the OWASP Top 10.'
    *   **Impact:** The system is vulnerable to various security threats, potentially exposing user data and compromising the integrity of the application.

## Enhancement Suggestions (Low)

*   **Usability: Clear Error Messages:** The SRS does not specify the quality of error messages.
    *   **Action:** Provide clear and concise error messages to users.
    *   **Impact:** Improves the user experience by helping users understand and resolve issues quickly.
*   **Gap: User Roles and Permissions:** The system lacks a functional requirement detailing user roles and permissions. While user stories mention administrators and security officers, there's no specification of their access privileges or responsibilities within the functional requirements.
    *   **Action:** Add a functional requirement (FR15): 'The system shall define and enforce different user roles with specific access privileges, including roles for administrators, security officers, drivers, and passengers.'
    *   **Impact:** Without defined user roles and permissions, the system might not be secure or manageable, potentially leading to unauthorized access or operational inefficiencies.
