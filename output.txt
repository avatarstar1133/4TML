# REQUIREMENTS ENGINEERING ANALYSIS REPORT

## Executive Summary
This report analyzes the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) and User Stories for the Online Food Ordering System. It identifies critical conflicts, missing requirements, and areas for enhancement. The analysis highlights a critical conflict in payment options, a lack of security and scalability considerations, and several gaps in functional requirements. Addressing these issues is crucial for the successful development and deployment of a reliable and user-friendly system.

## Critical Issues
*   **Conflict in Payment Options:**
    *   **Problem:** "FR2 states that users can only place orders after payment is confirmed, while FR3 states that the system shall allow users to pay after delivery. These two requirements directly contradict each other regarding the timing of payment."
    *   **Action:** The SRS needs to clarify the payment options and order flow. Define different 'order types'. One order type requires pre-payment, and another allows payment after delivery. Modify FR2 to state: 'For \'prepaid\' orders, users can only place orders after payment is confirmed.' Modify FR3 to state: 'For \'pay on delivery\' orders, the system shall allow users to pay after delivery to ensure satisfaction.'
    *   **Sources:** SRS-004, SRS-005
    *   **Impact:** The system cannot simultaneously enforce payment before order placement and allow payment after delivery, leading to a fundamental design flaw and user confusion. This will cause incorrect order processing and financial discrepancies.

## High Priority Issues
*   **Missing Security Requirements:**
    *   **Problem:** "The document lacks critical Non-Functional Requirements, specifically regarding security. There are no requirements addressing data encryption, user authentication security, or protection against common web vulnerabilities."
    *   **Action:** Add the following Non-Functional Requirements related to security: 'NFR3: All sensitive data (e.g., user credentials, payment information) must be encrypted both in transit (using HTTPS) and at rest (using AES-256 or similar). NFR4: The system must implement robust user authentication and authorization mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access. NFR5: The system must be protected against common web vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and cross-site request forgery (CSRF).'
    *   **Sources:** SRS-008, SRS-009
    *   **Impact:** The absence of security requirements exposes the system to significant risks, including data breaches, unauthorized access, and financial fraud. This can result in reputational damage, legal liabilities, and loss of user trust.
*   **Missing Role-Based Access Control:**
    *   **Problem:** Missing Role-Based Access Control
    *   **Action:** Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to sensitive functionalities based on user roles (e.g., admin, restaurant owner, customer).
    *   **Sources:** None
    *   **Impact:** RBAC is crucial for preventing unauthorized access and maintaining data integrity.
*   **Missing Detailed Logging and Auditing:**
    *   **Problem:** Missing Detailed Logging and Auditing
    *   **Action:** Implement detailed logging and auditing of all system events, including user logins, order placements, payment transactions, and admin actions.
    *   **Sources:** None
    *   **Impact:** Logging and auditing are essential for detecting and investigating security breaches, as well as ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements.
*   **Missing NFR for data backup and recovery procedures:**
    *   **Problem:** Missing NFR for data backup and recovery procedures
    *   **Action:** Add NFR for data backup and recovery procedures including frequency and retention periods.
    *   **Sources:** None
    *   **Impact:** In case of data loss, the system should have well-defined backup and recovery strategies.

## Medium Priority Issues
*   **Missing Order Cancellation Details:**
    *   **Problem:** "The functional requirements lack details about order cancellation. It is not specified whether users or restaurants can cancel orders, and under what conditions."
    *   **Action:** Add functional requirements specifying the conditions under which orders can be cancelled by users and restaurants. For example: 'FR6: Users can cancel orders within 15 minutes of placement, unless the restaurant has already marked the order as \'preparing\'. FR7: Restaurants can cancel orders if an item is out of stock, or if they are unable to fulfill the order due to unforeseen circumstances. A notification must be sent to the user upon cancellation.'
    *   **Sources:** SRS-003, SRS-004, SRS-005, SRS-006, SRS-007
    *   **Impact:** Without a defined order cancellation policy, the system may face disputes and inefficiencies in managing user requests and restaurant operations. It can lead to revenue loss or user dissatisfaction.
*   **Missing Restaurant Onboarding Process:**
    *   **Problem:** "The SRS does not specify how restaurants are added to the system initially. FR5 only describes the admin removing restaurants, but not how they are onboarded."
    *   **Action:** Add a functional requirement detailing the restaurant onboarding process: 'FR8: The system shall allow restaurants to register and create a profile, including providing necessary business information and menu details. Admin approval is required before a restaurant can start accepting orders.'
    *   **Sources:** SRS-007
    *   **Impact:** The system lacks a clear process for adding new restaurants, hindering the growth and scalability of the platform. This prevents new restaurants from joining and offering their services.
*   **Missing Refund Policy and Dispute Resolution:**
    *   **Problem:** "There is no mention of refund policy or dispute resolution in the SRS, which is important for user satisfaction. What if the order is wrong or not delivered?"
    *   **Action:** Add functional requirements outlining the refund policy and dispute resolution process: 'FR9: The system shall provide a mechanism for users to report issues with their orders (e.g., incorrect items, missing items, late delivery). FR10: The system shall define a clear refund policy, outlining the conditions under which a refund will be issued (e.g., order not delivered, significantly incorrect order). FR11: The system shall provide a dispute resolution process, involving mediation by the admin if necessary, to resolve conflicts between users and restaurants.'
    *   **Sources:** SRS-001, SRS-002
    *   **Impact:** Lack of a clear refund policy and dispute resolution mechanism can lead to user dissatisfaction and legal issues. This reduces user trust and can lead to negative reviews.
*   **Missing Specific Payment Methods:**
    *   **Problem:** "The system requirements do not define the specific payment methods supported (e.g., credit card, PayPal, mobile payment)."
    *   **Action:** Add a functional requirement specifying the supported payment methods: 'FR12: The system shall support the following payment methods: Credit Card (Visa, Mastercard, American Express), PayPal, and \\[mention any other mobile payment options].'
    *   **Sources:** SRS-002, SRS-004, SRS-005
    *   **Impact:** The absence of defined payment methods limits the system's flexibility and may exclude potential users who prefer specific payment options. This can lead to reduced sales and user adoption.
*   **Missing Scalability Requirements:**
    *   **Problem:** "The document lacks scalability requirements. There's no mention of how many concurrent users or orders the system should handle."
    *   **Action:** Add Non-Functional Requirements addressing scalability: 'NFR6: The system shall be able to handle at least 1000 concurrent users without significant performance degradation. NFR7: The system shall be able to process at least 500 orders per minute during peak hours.'
    *   **Sources:** SRS-008
    *   **Impact:** Without defined scalability requirements, the system may not be able to handle peak loads or future growth, leading to performance issues and user dissatisfaction as the user base grows.
*   **Missing system health dashboard:**
    *   **Problem:** Missing system health dashboard
    *   **Action:** Implement a system health dashboard to monitor key performance indicators (KPIs) such as response time, error rate, and resource utilization.
    *   **Sources:** None
    *   **Impact:** A system health dashboard allows for proactive identification and resolution of performance issues.
*   **Missing automated testing:**
    *   **Problem:** Missing automated testing
    *   **Action:** Implement automated testing (unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests) to ensure the quality and reliability of the system.
    *   **Sources:** None
    *   **Impact:** Automated testing helps to detect and prevent defects, reducing the risk of system failures.
*   **System not designed for extensibility and maintainability:**
    *   **Problem:** System not designed for extensibility and maintainability
    *   **Action:** Design the system to be easily extensible and maintainable by using modular architecture and well-defined interfaces.
    *   **Sources:** None
    *   **Impact:** A modular design reduces the complexity of the system and makes it easier to add new features or modify existing ones.
*   **Missing data retention policies:**
    *   **Problem:** Missing data retention policies
    *   **Action:** Specify data retention policies defining how long user data and order history will be stored.
    *   **Sources:** None
    *   **Impact:** Needed for compliance with data privacy regulations such as GDPR.
