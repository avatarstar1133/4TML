# CampusRide Requirements Analysis Report
## 1. Executive Summary
This report analyzes the requirements for the CampusRide application. A critical issue is the presence of a vague and undefined user story, hindering a clear understanding of the application's functionality. Additionally, key non-functional requirements related to security, performance, scalability, maintainability, and data privacy are missing. This report provides actionable recommendations to address these issues and enhance the overall quality of the requirements documentation.
## 2. Critical Issues (High Priority)
### Vague User Story
**Problem:** The user story 'huhuhihi' (STORY-001) is excessively vague and lacks meaningful information about the desired functionality or user needs. This makes it impossible to understand the intended purpose of this feature.
**Action:** The user story 'huhuhihi' must be replaced with a clear, concise, and well-defined user story. A good user story should follow the format: "As a [user role], I want [goal] so that [benefit]." For instance, a suitable user story would be: "As a student, I want to be able to request a ride to a specific campus location so that I can get there quickly and safely." Refer to source STORY-001.
### Missing Non-Functional Requirements
**Problem:** The requirements document lacks specific non-functional requirements for crucial aspects such as security, performance, scalability, maintainability, and data privacy. These elements are vital for the successful development and deployment of the CampusRide application.
**Action:** Include comprehensive non-functional requirements in the SRS to address security, performance, scalability, maintainability, and data privacy concerns.
## 3. Enhancement Suggestions (Low Priority)
### Security Enhancements
**Problem:** The current requirements do not explicitly address security concerns, potentially leading to vulnerabilities and risks to user data.
**Action:** Implement user authentication mechanisms to verify user identities, preventing unauthorized access. Data encryption, both in transit and at rest, should be implemented to protect sensitive user data. Access controls should also be established to restrict data access based on user roles and permissions.
### Performance Enhancements
**Problem:** The requirements do not specify performance expectations, potentially leading to a slow and unresponsive application.
**Action:** Define specific performance requirements by setting acceptable response times for key operations such as ride requests, location updates, and payment processing. These requirements will ensure a smooth and responsive user experience.
### Scalability Enhancements
**Problem:** The requirements do not address scalability, potentially limiting the application's ability to handle future growth.
**Action:** Include scalability requirements to ensure the system can handle an increasing number of users and ride requests without experiencing performance degradation. Specify how the system will scale its resources, such as servers and database capacity, to meet growing demand.
### Maintainability Enhancements
**Problem:** The requirements do not cover maintainability aspects, potentially increasing the cost and effort of future updates and bug fixes.
**Action:** Add maintainability requirements, including coding standards to ensure consistent code quality, documentation guidelines for clear explanations of the system's architecture and functionality, and modular design principles to facilitate future updates and bug fixes.
### Data Privacy Enhancements
**Problem:** The requirements lack specific guidance on data privacy, potentially leading to non-compliance with regulations and a lack of user trust.
**Action:** Specify detailed requirements for data privacy and compliance with relevant regulations, such as GDPR or CCPA. This includes outlining data collection, storage, and usage policies, as well as specifying user rights regarding their data.
## 4. Recommendations
To improve the requirements for the CampusRide application, the following actions are recommended:
1.  **Immediately revise the vague user story 'huhuhihi' (STORY-001) with a specific and well-defined user story that follows the "As a [user role], I want [goal] so that [benefit]" format.**
2.  **Incorporate the suggested enhancements for security, performance, scalability, maintainability, and data privacy as comprehensive non-functional requirements in the SRS.**
3.  **Conduct a thorough review of all requirements with stakeholders to ensure completeness, accuracy, and alignment with business goals.**
